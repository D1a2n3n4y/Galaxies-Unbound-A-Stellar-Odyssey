# Galaxies-Unbound-A-Stellar-Odyssey
Galaxies Unbound: A Stellar Odyssey, is the successor of Galaxies Unbound: Nova Kirbani. This time expanding the kerbal universe with 50+ new worlds for you to discover. In addition GU also optionally adds the solar stellar neighbourhood accurately up to 10-15 lighyears (1/10th real distance ingame). Beyond this distance only notible and famous stars exist up to 50 lighyears.

1. Start with a clean 1.10 or 1.11 KSP version. (avoid adding this to a heavily modded game)
2. Download R-T-B's Kopernicus.
3. Download Galaxies Unbound via the link posted above.
4. Drop the GU-folder in your GameData-folder.
5. Download EVE and/-or Scatterer for visuals.

--- Before launching the game. (!important!)
1. Go to the GU folder and find the GU-GENERAL_Settings.cfg
-> Here you will decide which part of the mod will be loaded. By changing from True to False you decide how big the mod will get.

* keep in mind planets only can orbit their stars. 

2. When using EVE (clouds). You will need to go to GU_Clouds and decompress the systems you picked. If you don't do this correcty clouds will not show up. Alpha Centauri and Epsilon Eridani are decompressed by default. For some planets you'll have to look in _Extra. I'm looking for a solution in the future as this part of the installationprocess is pretty annoying.

3. When using INSTANTIATOR. You will go to the Configs folder and find the compressed GU_Instantiator file. Decompress it for black hole -, neutron star beams and a Betelgeuse Atmo. (don't forget to remove the template file in the INSTANTIATOR mod folder (in GameData))

1. You need Render- and Texture quality at their highest setting. Otherwise a few worlds will spawn as black orbs. 
(looking for a fix)

--- After you followed these steps and the game loaded without errors, you should be able to add more mods.
--- This should be all to get GU working! ENJOY!
