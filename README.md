**How to install Galaxies Unbound: A Stellar Odyssey**

1. Start with a clean 1.10 or 1.11 KSP version. (avoid adding GU on top of a heavily modded game - no support)
2. Download Kopernicus.
3. Download Galaxies Unbound: A Stellar Odyssey via the link(s) posted above.
4. Drop the GU-folder in your GameData-folder.
--- Using Visuals. (!important!)
5. Download Eve-Redux/Eve and/-or Scatterer for visuals.
6. Download GU_Visuals_EVE and/-or GU_Visuals_Scatterer via the Github link of Galaxies Unbound: A Stellar Odyssey. And drop their respective GU-folders in GameData as well. At this point there should still be only 1 GU folder in your GameData.

^GU folder looks like this.

--- Before launching the game. (!important!)
1. Go to the GU folder and find the GU-GENERAL_Settings.cfg
-> Here you will decide which part of the mod will be loaded. By changing from True to False you decide how big the mod will get. 
-> All planet-systems have been enabled by default.

* keep in mind planets only can orbit their stars. 

2. When using **EVE** (clouds). You will need to go to GU_Clouds and compress/decompress the systems you picked or not. If you don't do this correctly, clouds will not show up. Alpha Centauri, Epsilon Eridani, Sirius, Tau Ceti and Trappist-1 are decompressed by default. For some planets you'll have to look in _Extra. I'm looking for a solution in the future as this part of the installationprocess is pretty annoying.

3. When using **Scatterer** (atm_shaders). You will need to go to GU_Scatterer and decompress the systems you picked. If you don't do this correcty clouds will not show up. Alpha Centauri, Epsilon Eridani, Sirius, Tau Ceti and Trappist-1 are decompressed by default. For some planets you'll have to look in _Extra. I'm looking for a solution in the future as this part of the installationprocess is ALSO pretty annoying.

4. When using **INSTANTIATOR**. Download the mod via its forumpage (it still works) and remove the exampleconfig.cfg from inside the folder. Once Kopernicus Particles work properly again, the beams will be replaced by particles instead of textures.

--- After launching the game. (!important!)

1. You need Texture quality at its highest setting. Otherwise a few worlds will spawn as black orbs.

--- After you followed these steps and the game loaded without errors, you should be able to add more mods.
--- This should be all to get GU working! ENJOY!
