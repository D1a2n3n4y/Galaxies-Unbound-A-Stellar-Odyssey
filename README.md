# How to install Galaxies Unbound: A Stellar Odyssey

1. Start with a clean 1.11 or 1.12 KSP version. (avoid adding GU on top of a heavily modded game - no support)
2. Download [Kopernicus](https://github.com/kopernicus/kopernicus/releases).
3. Download Galaxies Unbound: A Stellar Odyssey via the link(s) posted above.
4. Drop the GU-folder in your GameData-folder.
--- Using Visuals. (!important!)
5. Download [Eve-Redux/Eve](https://github.com/LGhassen/EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements/releases/) and/-or [Scatterer](https://github.com/LGhassen/Scatterer/releases) for visuals.

^GU folder looks like this.

# BEFORE launching the game. (!important!)
1. Go to the GU folder and find the GU-GENERAL_Settings.cfg
-> Here you will decide which part of the mod will be loaded. By changing from True to False you decide how big the mod will get. 
-> All planet-systems have been enabled by default.

2. When using visual mods, no need to worry! GU is now able to enable visuals on its own. Just install Eve-Redux/Eve and/-or Scatterer and you're good to go.

3. When using **INSTANTIATOR**. Download the mod via its forumpage or SpaceDock (it still works) and remove the exampleconfig.cfg from inside the folder. Once Kopernicus Particles work properly again, the beams will be replaced by particles instead of textures.

# How to use the HOMESWITCH mode.

1. We'll be using Alpha Centauri as an example. Go to the GU-GENERAL_Settings.cfg in the GU-folder and enable Alpha Centauri.

2. Go to this part of the cfg.

4. DONE! Now you'll start in your new homesystem! Don't forget to run KSP twice (2x) in order for visuals to work properly. 



# AFTER launching the game. (!important!)

1. You need Texture quality at its highest setting. Otherwise a few worlds will spawn as black orbs.

--- After you followed these steps and the game loaded without errors, you should be able to add more mods.
--- This should be all to get GU working! ENJOY!
